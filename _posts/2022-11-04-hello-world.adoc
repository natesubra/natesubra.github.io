= Hello World

== It's ALIVE

It's been a long time since I've blogged or written anything really. I'm aiming to change that with this blog.

My tentative plan is to talk about my thoughts around Red Teaming and the field I work. I'd also like to cover cool pieces of tech.

== The Blog

I wanted to talk about the technology this blog is built on.

=== AsciiDoc

This post is written in https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. AsciiDoc is a markup language I discovered a few years ago while looking for a better way to write documentation. I'd describe it as more powerful that Markdown, but not so insane as LaTeX. 

I write most of my work/public based documentation in Markdown. But for complex projects and personal projects I generally will choose AsciiDoc due to it's feature set and enhanced formatting capabilities. There's also the fantastic https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf[Asciidoctor PDF] toolchain. Which I've used to generate client documentation (maybe a post on that someday)

Some features AsciiDoc provides:

. Automatic ordering of lists (_I didn't type these numbers_)
. Being able to reference other files other files 
+
_the code below is just a link, the content is pulled in dynamically, you can even select specific lines_
+
.A swell looking label
[source,shell,linenums]
----
include::assets/2022-11-01_examplecode.sh[]
----
. Macros and text replacement
. Admonitions
+
IMPORTANT: This an admonition
+
NOTE: This is one too

Just to name a few. To get an idea of the capabilities of AsciiDoc, I recommend checking out the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[Quick Reference]

=== Visual Studio Code

I do my actual writing in https://code.visualstudio.com[VSCode]

I use the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode[AsciiDoc] to provide linting, syntax highlighting, and live preview of my content.

I use the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright[Spell Right] to further mitigate my fat fingers.

What does that look like?

Something like this:

=== Jekyll (and jekyll-asciidoc)

https://jekyllrb.com[Jekyll] is a static website generation tool. It converts markdown
to html to allow for simple and seamless creation of content. By adding the https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[Jekyll AsciiDoc] plugin, I can write in AsciiDoc, and it renders it to HTML. Letting me have the power and flexibility of AsciiDoc, while being able to use a well known and supported static site generator.

=== GitHub

I use https://pages.github.com[GitHub Pages] to host the content of this site. That means the complete source code is available on https://github.com/natesubra/natesubra.github.io[GitHub]. 

If you want to see what this post looked like before it was rendered to HTML, you can see it in AsciiDoc raw format https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natesubra/natesubra.github.io/main/_posts/2022-11-01-hello-world.adoc[here].

The pages themselves are built by https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub Actions]. 

=== CloudFlare

I use https://www.cloudflare.com[CloudFlare] as my domain registrar and to manage DNS for my domain.

Combining this with GitHub Pages allows me to use my domain as a landing page. This site is also available at https://natesubra.github.io

== Wrapping things up

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. I mostly right for myself but I hope others find it information/entertaining.
