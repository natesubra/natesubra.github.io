= Hello World

== It's ALIVE

It's been a long time since I've blogged or written anything publicly. I'm aiming to change that with this blog.

My tentative plan is to talk about my thoughts around Red Teaming and the various information security fields I work in. I also plan to talk about some of the tech I work with and share my security research publicly when possible.

== The blog itself

I wanted to talk about the technology this blog is built on. I've utilized many of the components for years and run many of the components in a professional setting.

=== AsciiDoc

This post is written in https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. AsciiDoc is a markup language I discovered a few years ago while looking for a better way to generate technical documentation. I'd describe it as being more powerful that Markdown, but not as complex as LaTeX.

Generally I write most of my public based documentation in Markdown. Markdown is the defacto standard for many technical documents. But for complex projects and personal projects I generally choose AsciiDoc for it's feature set and enhanced formatting capabilities. 

There's also the fantastic https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf[Asciidoctor PDF] toolchain. Which I've used to generate client documentation and reports (maybe a post on that someday)

Some of the features that AsciiDoc provides:

. Automatic ordering of lists (_I didn't type these numbers_)
. Being able to reference/include other files with syntax highlighting

The code below exists in my repo, but the content rendered here is inserted dynamically at generation. This allows me to reference code in my documentation, without requiring me to keep a copy in my post.

WARNING: This an admonition

For additional details regarding AsciiDoc capabilities, I recommend peeking at the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[Quick Reference]

=== Visual Studio Code

I write my posts using https://code.visualstudio.com[VSCode]

I use the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode[AsciiDoc] to provide linting, syntax highlighting, and live preview of my content.

I use the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright[Spell Right] to further mitigate my fat fingers.

What does that look like?

Something like this:

=== Jekyll (and jekyll-asciidoc)

https://jekyllrb.com[Jekyll] is a static website generation tool. It converts markdown
to html to allow for simple and seamless creation of content. By adding the https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[Jekyll AsciiDoc] plugin, I can write in AsciiDoc, and it renders it to HTML. Letting me have the power and flexibility of AsciiDoc, while simultaneously being able to use a well known and supported static site generator.

=== GitHub

I use https://pages.github.com[GitHub Pages] to host the content of this site. That means the complete source code is available on https://github.com/natesubra/natesubra.github.io[GitHub]. 

If you want to see what this post looked like before it was rendered to HTML, you can see it in AsciiDoc raw format https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natesubra/natesubra.github.io/main/_posts/2022-11-04-hello-world.adoc[here].

The pages themselves are built by https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub Actions]. 

=== CloudFlare

I use https://www.cloudflare.com[CloudFlare] as my domain registrar and to manage DNS for my domain.

CloudFlare also provides CDN capabilities. They also terminate SSL, although the source pages are also protected via GitHub.

Combining this with GitHub Pages allows me to use my domain as a landing page. This site is also available at https://natesubra.github.io

== Wrapping things up

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. I mostly right for myself but I hope others find it information/entertaining.
