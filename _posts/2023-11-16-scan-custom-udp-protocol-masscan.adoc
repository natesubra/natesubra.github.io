One of my security researcher acquaintances (hi Reid!) was working on an interesting problem set the other day.

The goal was to identify hosts on the internet running a custom UDP protocol. The problem was custom scanning at scale is kind of a pain. You're looking at writing a decent amount of C to scan for what is often a one off. 

Reid discovered that Nmap has a https://nmap.org/book/nmap-payloads.html[feature] that allows you to specify a custom UDP payload to send to a host:

This is great, but Nmap is single threaded and not the fastest scanner out there (by design). We want to scan at scale, so we need something faster.

Well, masscan supports many Nmap (via libpcap), and checking the masscan man file we find https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/blob/2a547f72cee47f8a47d367c7ef43051455401e3e/doc/masscan.8.markdown?plain=1#L124[this] gem:

[source,man]
....
  * `--nmap-payloads FILE`: read in a file in the same format as 
    the nmap file `nmap-payloads`. This contains UDP payload, so that we
	can send useful UDP packets instead of empty ones. Similar to
	`--pcap-payloads`.
....

So, we can use masscan to scan for custom UDP protocols by creating an nmap-payloads file with our port/payload and then pass that file to masscan.

Lets create a new nmap payload file with the following contents:

.my-payload-file.txt
[source,text]
....
# we've been trying to reach you about your cars extended warranty
udp 1234
    "\x77\x65\x27\x76\x65\x20\x62\x65\x65\x6e\x20\x74\x72\x79\x69\x6e\x67\x20\x74\x6f\x20\x72\x65\x61\x63\x68\x20\x79\x6f\x75\x20\x61\x62\x6f\x75\x74\x20\x79\x6f\x75\x72\x20\x63\x61\x72\x73\x20\x65\x78\x74\x65\x6e\x64\x65\x64\x20\x77\x61\x72\x72\x61\x6e\x74\x79"
....

and then leverage masscan to send that payload when scanning:

[source,sh]
....
masscan <target_range> --nmap-payloads my-payload-file.txt -p U:1234
....

Masscan also has the option to parse a pcap and utilize responses from that when scanning. Save some typing and potentially some fat fingers.

[source,text]
....
  * `--pcap-payloads FILE`: read packets from a libpcap file containing packets
    and extract the UDP payloads, and associate those payloads with the
	destination port. These payloads will then be used when sending UDP
	packets with the matching destination port. Only one payload will
	be remembered per port. Similar to `--nmap-payloads`.
....

NOTE: These are documented in the man page, but not in the help `masscan -h` output, always check your man pages and source code to know the true capabilities of your tools
